		<h3> About me</h3>
		<div class= "about"><p> Welcome to my website! My name is Endy Godinez. I am a 12th grader at Canoga Park High school. Currently, I am a second year mentee 
		in Northrop Grumman's HIP program. I am a member of MESA and the CPHS Robotics team. I have maintained a 4.0 GPA(unweighted) throughout my high school career. 
		My favorite classes include chemistry, physics and environmental science. </p>
		
		<p>I enjoy binge watching tv shows during my free time. The shows I watch vary from forensics to drama. I also enjoy going out for walks with my dog, Floppy.
		I like solving puzzles when I need a break from school. </p>
		<p>In the year to come, my goal is to be accepted in my top choice university. The goal is to go to the University of California-Los Angeles or University of
		California-Santa Barbara. My main interest is bioengineering and chemical engineering. I would like to study these majors in the future.  </p>
